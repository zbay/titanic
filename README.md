# titanic

This is my first pass at predicting the survivors of the Titanic, from that semi-famous Kaggle competition.

"Scripts/Titanic machine learning project.ipynb" is the iPython notebook in which I detail my work. Install Python 3 and Jupyter, fork and clone this repo, and you should be able to view it.

Alternatively, you can view it by pasting https://github.com/zbay/titanic/blob/master/Scripts/Titanic%20machine%20learning%20project.ipynb into the bar at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
